# osu-cs361-w24

This will be the repository that I use for CS361: Software Engineering 1 (OSU W24)

What it will eventually be is a simple command line app that will prompt the user to enter the name of a board game that they've enjoyed in the past and the app will, based off of their input, suggest them a new board game. Additional functionality will have the user to be able to search for a board game by name and be given that game's boardgamegeek.com page.

For this project I've used:
 - Miguel Ángel García's Python Inquirer: https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer
 - Kenneth Reitz's Python CLI Tool: https://github.com/kennethreitz-archive/clint
