# osu-cs361-w24

A repository for a personal project started while taking CS361: Software Engineering 1 (OSU W24)

This program is a simple command line program that allows users to discover or look up their favorite board game utilizing Board Game Geek's API and board game database. It was an introduction to microservices and thusly utilizes a microservice, created by a partner, to retrieve Board Game Geek's 'Top 50 Games'. 

For this project I've used:
 - Miguel Ángel García's Python Inquirer: https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer
 - Kenneth Reitz's Python CLI Tool: https://github.com/kennethreitz-archive/clint
